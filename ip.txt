IP packets carry data during transmission and have a header that contains
information helping them to find their way and to reassemble after transmission.

The identification tag helps reassemble the packet from several eventual
fragments. Data sent over a network is broken down into small sections
enveloped in these packets. IP networks, such as the internet, usually are not
secure. Packets can be lost, delayed, and arrive in the wrong order. Once they
arrive at the destination, the identification tag helps to identify the packet and to
reassemble the data back to its original form.
The fragmented flag states whether the packet can be fragmented or not.
The fragment offset is a field to identify which fragment this packet is attached to.
Time to Live (TTL) is a number that indicates how many hops (router passes) the
packet can make before it dies. Usually, at each router, a packet is analyzed, and
based on the information present at that router on other neighboring routers, a
choice is made as to which route is best. The packet is then forwarded to that
next router. In this configuration, a packet may well go round. There is also
flooding as another method, which implies sending a copy of the packet to each
neighboring router; then, only the target machine consumes the packet. Other
packets will keep roaming. TTL is a number, typically 255, which decreases each
time a packet passes a router. This way, redundant packets will ultimately die
once the TTL reaches zero.
The header checksum is a number used for error detection and correction during
packet transmission. The data in the packet is fed into a mathematical algorithm.
The resulting sum travels with the data in the packet. Upon reception, this sum is
calculated again using the same algorithm. If it is the same as the original sum,
the data is good. Otherwise, it is considered corrupt, and the packet discarded.
The payload is the actual data being carried.
